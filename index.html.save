    <h2><abbr>MPL</abbr> Programming Language</h2>
    <a href="https://github.com/yugyfoog/MPL">github.com/yugyfoog/MPL</a>
    <p>
      <abbr>MPL</abbr> is a mathematical programming language that I designed.
      It is a simple scripting language.
      It can be used interactivly but that was not my intension,
      so don't expect it to be user friendly.

      I wanted a small/simple language that can be used for calculations
      that are too cumbersome for a hand-held calculator, yet dosen't require
      a real programming language.

      I also don't like how many mathematical programming languages
      conflate arrays and vectors/matricies. I wanted a language
      that had array semantics so multipling two arrays produces
      an array of products. However, for multipling two vectors I want a
      dot product and multipling a <em>n</em>x<em>m</em> matrix with a
      <em>m</em>x<em>p</em> matrix should result in a
      <em>n</em>x<em>p</em> matrix.
    </p>
    <p>
      This interpreter is mostly finished for the core language.
      I still need more work on error checking and reporting.
      There is still a lot of work to do for the standard library.

    <h1>Why yugyfoog?</h1>
    <p>
      Many years ago I needed a watch.
      While looking at watches in a store I saw some Mickey Mouse watches.
      I remembered how when I was a kid a wanted one.
      There were other Disney watches there too and I noticed that a goofy watch was backwards.
      Something about a watch whose hands moved counter clockwise appealed to me.
      There's no reason a clock's hands move clockwise other than convention. So why not?
      I didn't buy the watch then but must have told someone about it because next Christmas
      I had one.
      After that every birthday and Christmas I receved more and more Goofy presents.
      I became the <q>Goofy Guy</q> of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years later, but still awhile ago, I was signing up for some sort of instant messaging service.
      I didn't want to use my real name (boring) but I have no nickname.
      So I first choose <q>goofyguy</q>. But that was taken. Then I though spelling "goofyguy" backwards (like the watch)
      would be a goofy thing to do. The rest is history.
